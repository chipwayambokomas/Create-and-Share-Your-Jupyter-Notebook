# Create-and-Share-Your-Jupyter-Notebook
This repository contains my final assignment for the IBM "Tools for Data Science" Coursera course. The Jupyter Notebook DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb includes an overview of data science languages, libraries, and tools, examples of Python arithmetic expressions, and demonstrates markdown and code cell usage, with screenshots documenting the tasks.
